Use Case: AR in Gaming

Augmented reality (AR) is revolutionizing the gaming world by seamlessly blending virtual elements with the real world. This creates a more immersive and interactive experience for people, allowing them to engage with games in new and exciting ways. AR games overlay virtual objects and characters onto the real world, blurring the lines between reality and the game. AR games are more interactive than traditional games, requiring players to physically move around and engage with their surroundings. 

Product description:
we have built an AR game on Unity in which we need to shoot spaceships(virtual elements) that appear in the real world/your surroundings. our app is named "iot game". In the video that we have provided, you can see our app on the home screen. Once we open it, you need to move your camera around, then you can see the spaceships. there is a white button on the screen, which we use to fire the spaceships. we also included a sound effect when you click on the button to shoot the bullet to make it more realistic. This is a very fun game. We have used Ar foundation and Arcore kits for this app. 

Problems we faced during this process:
1. To properly align the spaceships in our plane.
2. Writing scripts for various aspects of our game.
3. creating a 3d model of spaceships.
